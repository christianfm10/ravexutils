# OTP Fetcher for Axiom Trade Authentication

This module provides functionality to automatically fetch OTP (One-Time Password) codes
from email for Axiom Trade authentication. It connects to an IMAP email server and
searches for OTP codes in unread Axiom security emails.

## Key Features:
- **IMAP Email Access**: Connects to inbox.lv or other IMAP servers
- **Automatic OTP Extraction**: Parses email subject and body for OTP codes
- **Time-based Filtering**: Fetch only recent OTP emails within a time window
- **Wait for OTP**: Poll for new OTP emails with configurable timeout
- **Mark as Read**: Automatically marks processed emails as read

## Dependencies:
- `imapclient`: Modern, Pythonic IMAP client library
- `email`: Standard library for email parsing
- `re`: Regular expressions for OTP extraction

## Usage:
```python
from axiomclient.email.otp_fetcher import OtpFetcher, from_env

# Create from environment variables
fetcher = from_env()

# Or create with explicit credentials
fetcher = OtpFetcher(
    email="user@inbox.lv",
    password="email_password"
)

# Fetch latest OTP from unread emails
otp = fetcher.fetch_otp()

# Wait for new OTP with timeout
otp = fetcher.wait_for_otp(timeout_seconds=120, check_interval_seconds=5)
```

    # OTP Fetcher for Email-Based Authentication

    Connects to an IMAP email server to automatically retrieve OTP codes
    from Axiom Trade security emails. Supports filtering by read status
    and time window.

    ## Features:
    - Connects to IMAP server with SSL/TLS
    - Searches for unread Axiom security emails
    - Extracts OTP codes from subject line and email body
    - Marks processed emails as read
    - Filters emails by date/time
    - Polls for new emails with configurable timeout

    ## Design Decisions:
    - Uses IMAPClient for cleaner API than standard imaplib
    - Searches UNSEEN flag to avoid reprocessing emails
    - Extracts OTP from subject first (faster) before parsing body
    - Multiple regex patterns for robustness across email formats
    - Automatically marks emails as read after extraction

    ## Security Notes:
    - Credentials should be stored in environment variables
    - Uses SSL/TLS for secure IMAP connection
    - Does not store credentials in memory longer than necessary

    ## Example:
    ```python
    fetcher = OtpFetcher("user@inbox.lv", "password")

    # Get latest OTP
    otp = fetcher.fetch_otp()
    if otp:
        print(f"OTP code: {otp}")

    # Wait for new OTP (useful after triggering auth)
    otp = fetcher.wait_for_otp(timeout_seconds=120)

        - `password` (str): Email account password or app-specific password

        ## Side Effects:
        - Stores credentials in instance (consider security implications)
        - Does not establish connection (lazy connection on first use)

    # Create OTP Fetcher from Environment Variables

    Convenience factory function that reads email credentials from
    environment variables and creates an OtpFetcher instance.

    ## Environment Variables:
    - `INBOX_LV_EMAIL`: Email address (e.g., "user@inbox.lv")
    - `INBOX_LV_PASSWORD`: Email password or app-specific password

    ## Returns:
    - `OtpFetcher`: Configured fetcher instance if env vars are set
    - `None`: If either environment variable is missing

    ## Security Best Practice:
    Storing credentials in environment variables is more secure than
    hardcoding them in source code. Consider using:
    - `.env` files with python-dotenv for local development
    - Secret management services for production (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager)
    - Environment variables in CI/CD pipelines

    ## Example:
    ```python
    # Set environment variables
    import os
    os.environ['INBOX_LV_EMAIL'] = 'user@inbox.lv'
    os.environ['INBOX_LV_PASSWORD'] = 'secure_password'

    # Create fetcher from environment
    fetcher = from_env()

    if fetcher:
        otp = fetcher.fetch_otp()
    else:
        print("Email credentials not configured in environment")
    ```

    ## Usage with .env file:
    ```bash
    # .env file
    INBOX_LV_EMAIL=user@inbox.lv
    INBOX_LV_PASSWORD=secure_password
    ```

    ```python
    # Python code
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    from axiomclient.email.otp_fetcher import from_env

    load_dotenv()  # Load .env file
    fetcher = from_env()  # Create fetcher from loaded env vars
    ```
    """
    email_address = os.environ.get("INBOX_LV_EMAIL")
    password = os.environ.get("INBOX_LV_PASSWORD")

    # Only create fetcher if both credentials are present
    if email_address and password:
        return OtpFetcher(email_address, password)

    return None
